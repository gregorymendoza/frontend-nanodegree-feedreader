# Feed Reader Testing

Final project of the Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program. A web-based application that reads RSS feeds was given. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite. Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company, so the task was to complete the suite.
